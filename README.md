# Project 1 üéâ

Congratulations on nearing the end of Unit 1! We'll be using the concepts covered over the previous two weeks to make your first application.

## The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

### Functional Requirements
1. Be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Consume data from an external source (3rd party API), and render that data into the DOM.
3. Use flexbox (`display: flex`) and/or CSS Grid (`display: grid`).
4. Implement responsive design on 3 screen sizes (including desktop) using 2 media queries (tablet and mobile).
5. Host on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

### Procedural Requirements
1. Have GitHub commits (documenting good progress) **every day**.
2. Have a well-developed `README.md` file explaining technologies used, approaches taken, a link to your live site, relevant instructions for viewers, and any unsolved problems.

## The Post-MVP

Achieve your MVP with time to spare? Try aiming for some stretch goals. (The following are not mandatory for your first app.)

- Look into [localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) so you can save data to the user's browser.
   - Check this very helpful tutorial on [Local Storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8yJCeuP6I8).
- Add a second API.
- Add creative use of event listeners and UI interactions, such as CSS animations and transitions.
- Get input from a UX student on how to make your app have intuitive UI and design.

## The Presentation

You will present your app to your cohort. Be sure to show it's functionality, including both responsive sizes.

# GETTING STARTED üèÅ

##  STEP 1. Read All Directions BEFORE Starting

_We'll know if you don't._

## STEP 2. Make A New Repo

You will start by creating your project repository on your **personal** GitHub. _(Refer to the Resources section below if you need help with this.)_

<br>

| **DO**                              | **DO NOT**                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ... Use your personal GitHub.       | ... Use your Enterprise GitHub.    |
| ... Make a new repo through GitHub. | ... Clone the SEB repo.            |
| ... Make the new repo public.       | ... Initialize with a ReadMe file. |

<br>

## STEP 3. Research and Choose Your API

You have freedom to choose an API that aligns with your interests or goals, but we have a few requirements for choosing an API:

  * First, we **highly** recommend using an API that is public, free, and if an API key is required, that it accepts that key in the URL or header. 
    * If your API requires membership, granted access, payment, or OAuth, it will take too much time to actually gain access to the data. Be careful with this.
  * Second, **you must prove you can retrieve and consume data at project pitch time to be approved.** If you cannot do this, we will tell you to find another API.

<br>

| **DO**                                                    | **DO NOT**                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ... Have some fun in choosing an API.                     | ... Choose an API that will make the next week of your life hell.       |
| ... Consider the clarity of the API's data structure.     | ... Choose an API that will make the next seven days of your life hell. |
| ... Consider the thoroughness of the API's documentation. | ... Choose an API that will make the next 168 hours of your life hell.  |

<br>

Thankfully, there are _literally hundreds_ of options for APIs that have been used and tested by previous students. Refer to the Resources section below for suggestions and lists of available APIs; if you find one not on this list that you'd like to use, feel free, just remember the above requirements.


## STEP 4. Wireframe Your App

You can make your wireframes as lo-fi or hi-res as you'd like, just prove that you've thought about what this layout will require.

##  STEP 5. Pitch Your Project Idea

Before you start coding away, you must meet with an instructor to get your ideas approved. **You must have your ideas prepared and written up in a ReadMe file to get approved, including the content listed below.**

Your ReadMe **must** contain:

1. **Title:** A working title for your app. (Feel free to have some fun with this.)
2. **Description:** A few sentences summarizing the features, functions, and goals.
3. **Wireframes:** Mockups of your app on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
4. **API:** Which API you will be using. 
5. **MVP:** Write out what your goals are for MVP, including the minimum, need-to-have features of your app.
6. **Post-MVP:** Write out what your goals are for post-MVP, including nice-to-have features that you would like to implement once your MVP is complete.


##  STEP 6. Get Hacking

### What does project week look like?

All students will be able to work independelty on this project. You must attend class each day and check in with instructors so you can be counted as present. But, you can work in any available space on campus.

Instructors will be available for assistance all day. Every morning and/or evening, you should plan and think through what you need to meet MVP goals and plan accordingly. As the week progresses, instructors may go around routinely to see what "percent of MVP" you are at with your project.

## Incomplete Projects
Incomplete projects will be given an extension. An instructor will follow up with you to discuss the details of the resubmission. **Note that you are allowed one extension on only one of the four projects.**

## Suggested APIs

Here is a good list of [Free APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis). 
   - Not all APIs on this list are created equal, and some may not work anymore, but there are many that are good. Take some time to parse through the topics that interest you and explore the documentation on each API. (Bad documentation is a üö©)
